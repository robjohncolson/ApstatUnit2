Objective: Convert the current AP Statistics Unit 1 `index.html` file into a functional `index.html` file for Unit 2 (Exploring Two-Variable Data), maintaining a self-contained, monolithic structure.

Source File: `index.html` (The current file, containing Unit 1 code and data)
Target File: `index.html` (This same file, to be modified for Unit 2)
Reference Files (For YOUR manual data input later): `knowledge-tree.md`, `allUnitsData.js` (or similar source for Unit 2 topic details), `ls-output.txt` (for PDF path confirmation)

Please perform the following modifications within this file:

1.  **Update Unit ID Constant:**
    *   Find the line: `const UNIT_ID = '1';`
    *   Change it to: `const UNIT_ID = '2';`

2.  **Update Static HTML Content:**
    *   Change the `<title>` tag content from "Unit 1: Exploring One-Variable Data" to: `AP Statistics Unit 2: Exploring Two-Variable Data`.
    *   Change the main `<h1>` heading content from "Unit 1: Exploring One-Variable Data" to: `AP Statistics Unit 2: Exploring Two-Variable Data`.
    *   Update the exam weight text (in the `div` with `bg-yellow-100`) to reflect Unit 2's weight (e.g., "Unit 2 represents 5-7% of the AP Statistics Exam", adjust % as needed).

3.  **Prepare Topic Data Area for Manual Replacement:**
    *   Locate the start of the `const pdfFiles = [` array definition (around line 980).
    *   **Delete all the topic objects** currently inside the square brackets `[]`, from the first `{` representing Topic 1.1 down to the last `}` representing the Unit 1 capstone.
    *   Leave the code as: `const pdfFiles = [ /* USER: PASTE UNIT 2 TOPIC DATA HERE */ ];`
    *   *(Action Required By User (You): After Claude runs, you MUST manually paste the complete JavaScript array data for Unit 2's topics into this empty array definition. Ensure all topic `id`s are "2-n", `name`s are "Topic 2.n", descriptions match Unit 2, video URLs are correct for Unit 2, `quizId`s are "2-n_q1", and `questionPdf`/`answersPdf` paths correctly use `pdfs/unit2/`)*

4.  **Verify Local Storage Key Usage:**
    *   Confirm that the `loadTopicProgress` and `saveTopicProgress` functions use the `UNIT_ID` constant correctly to form the localStorage key (e.g., `localStorage.setItem('apStatsUnit' + UNIT_ID + 'Progress', ...)`). No change should be needed here if Unit 1 was working correctly, but double-check.

5.  **Verify Supabase `unit_id` Usage:**
    *   Confirm that the `saveCompletionToSupabase` and `deleteCompletionFromSupabase` functions correctly use the `UNIT_ID` constant when sending data to Supabase. No change should be needed here.

**Summary of Manual Step:**
The most important step **after** running this prompt is for **you** to manually populate the `const pdfFiles = []` array with the correct, complete topic data for **Unit 2**, ensuring all IDs, names, descriptions, video URLs, quiz IDs, and PDF paths (using `pdfs/unit2/`) are accurate for Unit 2.
